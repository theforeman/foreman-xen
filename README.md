# Foreman XEN Plugin

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/theforeman/foreman-xen/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/theforeman/foreman-xen)

This plugin enables managing of XEN Server as a Compute Resource in Foreman.

## Installation

Packages are available for Debian based distribtions as **ruby-foreman-xen** and for Red Hat based distributions as **ruby193-rubygem-foreman_xen** The gem name is **foreman_xen**.

Please see the Foreman manual for further instructions:

* [Foreman: How to Install a Plugin](http://theforeman.org/plugins/#2.Installation)

## Image based provisioning

In order to use the cloud-init functionality users need to:

- install the `genisoimage` package
- mount a "NFS ISO Library" (as XenServer calls it) which is attached to the Xen pool to a location writable by the foreman user.
- set this mount point / path as ISO library mountpoint in the compute resource

foreman_xen then creates a network configuration file, renders the user_data template, puts them in an ISO, copies this ISO to the attached ISO-library and attaches it to the created VM, where cloud-init can use the data provided to initialize the VM.
